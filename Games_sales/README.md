# Сomputer games sales 2012-2016

#### Project Description

Historical data up to 2016 on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation) are available from open sources.

The customer is the online store "Stream", which sells computer games worldwide.

It is necessary to identify the patterns that determine the success of a game. This will allow you to bet on a potentially popular product, plan advertising campaigns and make a forecast for 2017.
