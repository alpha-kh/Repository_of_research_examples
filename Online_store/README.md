# Online store data research

**Project Description**

Data from a large online store is available.

*First part of the project* - prioritization of hypotheses in order to maximize the expected improvement of key business metrics

*Goal:* Prioritize hypotheses prepared jointly with marketers to increase the revenue of the online store with the specified parameters Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort.

*Second part of the project* - analysis of the A/B test results

*Goal:* Evaluate the results of the A/B test based on the study of the main metrics:

- cumulative revenue
- cumulative average check
- cumulative average number of orders per visitor.

To identify business growth points, it is necessary to analyze and compare data on users from groups A and B, and also test the following hypotheses:

- there are no differences in the average number of orders per user between groups A and B
- there are no differences in the average check between groups A and B

The statistical significance of the differences will be calculated using the Mann-Whitney U-test.

Based on the results of the assessment, a decision will be made to terminate, continue the test, or recognize the greater effectiveness of one of the groups.
